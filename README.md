# UK Non-Fiction Book Price Model, 2024

In this project we will be working with a dataset of non-fiction hardback and paperback books from 2014&ndash;2023. The dataset is made up of the top 5,000 titles for each year as sold through Nielsen Bookscan's Total Consumer Market in the UK. Additional datapoints for each title were added from Goodreads (GR) and Google Books (GB).*

*(*Goodreads data added via library import/export function. Google Books data added via API call. Original data accessed via Nielsen Bookdata.*)
